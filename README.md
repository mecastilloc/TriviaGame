week 5 homework Trivia Game


### Option Two: Advanced Assignment (Timed Questions)

**[Live Demo](https://mecastilloc.github.io/TriviaGame/index.html)**.

* This trivia game is about Formula One knowledge. When playng it shows only one question until the player answers it or their time of 15 seconds runs out.

* If the player selects the correct answer, it shows a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, the next question will be displayed (without user input).

* The scenario for wrong answers and time-outs is:

  * If the player runs out of time, it tells the player that time's up and displays the correct answer. Waits a few seconds, then shows the next question.
  * If the player chooses the wrong answer, it tells the player they selected the wrong option and then displays the correct answer. Waits a few seconds, then shows the next question.

* On the final screen, shows the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
